# Quartus_Prime_Intro
A tutorial from Intel Corporation that presents an introduction to the Quartus Prime CAD system. It gives a general overview of a typical CAD flow for designing circuits that are implemented by using FPGA devices and shows how this flow is realized in the Quartus Prime Software.

# Goals
The purpose of this project is to learn about:
- Creating a project
- Design entry using Verilog code
- Synthesizing a circuit specified in Verilog code
- Fitting a synthesized circuit into an Intel FPGA
- Assigning the circuit inputs and outputs to specific pins on the FPGA
- Simulating the designed circuit
- Programming and configuring the FPGA chip on Intelâ€™s DE-series board
